# Heart Disease Prediction



## Overview

This repository contains the code for a Heart Disease Prediction project. The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting the likelihood of an individual having heart disease based on various health-related features.

This project includes the following files:

-   `app.py`: Contains the main application logic and user interface, likely built using a framework like Streamlit or Flask, allowing users to interact with the prediction model.
-   `ml_code.py`: Implements the machine learning model used for heart disease prediction, including data preprocessing, model training, and prediction functionalities.

## Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AkshithSai-24/HeartDiseasePrediction.git
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd HeartDiseasePrediction
    ```
3.  It is highly recommended to create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
4.  Install the necessary dependencies. While a `requirements.txt` file  provided in the context,
    
     use:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1.  **Ensure all dependencies are installed** as mentioned in the requirements.txt section .
2.  **Run the application** by executing the `app.py` file. This likely launches a web application if Streamlit or Flask is used:
    ```bash
    python app.py         # If using Flask or another framework (check the file for run instructions)
    ```
3.  **Interact with the user interface** provided by the application. You will likely be able to input various health features, and the model will output a prediction regarding the likelihood of heart disease.

## File Descriptions

  - `app.py`: This file serves as the main entry point for the Heart Disease Prediction application. It likely handles user input through a graphical or command-line interface and uses the functionalities provided by `ml_code.py` to make predictions.
  - `ml_code.py`: This file contains the core logic for the heart disease prediction model. It likely includes steps for data loading and preprocessing, the implementation of a machine learning algorithm ), model training on relevant datasets, and the function to generate predictions based on input features.
